So the problem related to a former installation of "sldap". So
now I purged everything and tried running setup-kolab again. It
seems now to be fine. Except that I can't send emails, getting
SMTP error 454 in roundcube.

self-hosting amateurs. On the one hand, I wished they could get
some inspiration from [YunoHost](http://yunohost.org/), on the
other hand, Kolab has been there for so long that it's very
professional.

Let’s see how it goes…
