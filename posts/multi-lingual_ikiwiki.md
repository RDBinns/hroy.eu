I know I haven’t started writing yet, I’m already worried about
technical issues. How can I handle writing in different languages
here? I’ve seen the [po plugin](http://ikiwiki.info/plugins/po/)
but it requires me to set a “Master language” for the whole
system. Rather, I want to be able to set different master
languages for each post.[^1] Because sometimes I start writing in
French, some other times I start writing in English. Most of the
time I don’t translate myselft. So translation isn’t really what
I’m looking for.

If you’ve got any suggestion on how to solve this, you’re very
welcome. Until then, I’ll just stick to tagging.

[[!tag lang:en ikiwiki]]

[^1]: You might wonder: what for? I’d like to add a
<code>lang="en|fr"</code> attribute for each post, that would
allow me for instance to enable hyphenation at line-breaks.
