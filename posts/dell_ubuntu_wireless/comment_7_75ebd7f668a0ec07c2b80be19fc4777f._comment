As the only non free things needed is linked to the intel chip, I just looked whether the atheros has the same problem.

The wrong chip you get seems to work on the libre kernel :

I don't know what you'll decide but... you may want to find a solution to make it works instead of changing it ;)

Have a nice day ^^
