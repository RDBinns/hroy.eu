Hey Cryptie! Yes, Emma told me that you had the XPS-13. Are you happy with it BTW?

I know it's not a problem specific to France, friends in Finland reported to me that the recent purchases of XPS-13 also had the same Qualcomm wireless chipset. However, Dell sites (US, France and Finland) still advertise and sell the Intel chip (there are no mentions of the Qualcomm chip anywhere AFAICS).

The whole problem is the complete un-professionalism that Dell has demonstrated in trying to deal with this matter! It's been more than a week now, and I still haven't got an answer from them: I still don't know if they even sell the intel chip any more! It looks like the sales department over there don't even know what they're selling! 

They're claiming that I bought the Qualcomm despite evidence to the contrary that the only option on the website is Intel (but maybe they can't even access their own websiteâ€¦). It's a complete waste of time and quite frankly this lack of professionalism is baffling. Am I talking to a computer manufacturer here?
