2) some time one of the ctrl/fn/alt key stays stuck and make me do stupid things...
(like just now : I wanted to make one post with all and, I don't know how, my post has been sent before I ended it, grrr)
3) there is a strange managing of audio through accounts. I have two accounts + the invited one on mine. 
Whenever I have a video waiting or music on one account and I switch to another, the audio do not work in the second one.

All these are not important issues, but it is a bit annoying for a pc sold with ubuntu ^^'

This slowly make me think about switching to Debian on this one but as I have (for the first time of my life!) a warranty also on the OS and that I have always being either on ubuntu or on Trisquel... I just postponed the decision for now, may be if it becomes really unstable... 
I would have more easily switch to Trisquel but the wifi chip needs the non free kernel :/ 

tl;dr I'm quite happy but it is not perfect.

I hope everything will end up well for your's. ^^
Have a nice day
