I was afraid that it would be like that. 
When I first had the wifi issue with the intel chip (which this on is patched) I tried to contact them.
I end up on the technical support page where they asked me to run a .exe to pre-check my computer ^^'
As the next update fixed my issue I didn't think about it until I saw your post.

For your question about whether they still sell the intel version, you may ask on one of our list, you may either find a counter example or find more people to make a join request (?).
I feel like we all fell in love in it (or in the idea of no M$ tax ^^') and end up buying it whenever we need a new laptop ;-)

By the way, my general point of view is that it works quite well and I'm happy. 

But a few details disappoint me :
1) since a couple of week, ubuntu is not as stable as on my others devices.
All my devices are on the 12.04 as I refuse to switch until they remove their spyware in the dash.
But on my others PCs I nearly never have ubuntu error and it begins to happens once a week on this one.
