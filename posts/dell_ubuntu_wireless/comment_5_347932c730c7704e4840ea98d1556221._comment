I thought it could run with entirely free software! What about the [sputnik kernel](https://launchpad.net/~canonical-hwe-team/+archive/sputnik-kernel)? Are you saying there are also issues with the intel wireless chip? 

I canâ€™t believe it!

(And yes, I intend to run Debian on it in the future, as soon as there's GNOME 3.10 support)
