Sputnik is based on the classical linux kernel not on the 100% free one...

When I bought my laptop, I looked at the Trisquel forum to search if someone already tried it it and I discovered this post :
<https://trisquel.info/fr/forum/dell-xps-13>

So I searched a bit and it looks like that the intel chips uses a free driver but needs some non free firmware :
<https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Dell/Dell%20XPS%2013>

So you will be able to install Debian but only with the non free installer. 
I'm sure you are as disappointed as I was when I discovered it. :/

Each time I think Dell did the right thing, they find a way to deceive me...
