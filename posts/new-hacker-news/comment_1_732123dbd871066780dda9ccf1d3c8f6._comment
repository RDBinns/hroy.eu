Hello,

You're right, there is some lack of visibility relative to hacker's world, their meetings, discussions & debates, subculture.

Till recently, it seemed to me that statusnet, just before it switched to pumpio, was the right tool to stay connected with hacker's news and culture.
At that time i could follow some hackers groups (Chaos Computer Club ...) and projects (Tor, freedombox ...), and identica/Statusnet was good to me for discovering and digging into hackers news. The groups under statusnet were like 'virtual communities', and the switch to pumpio 'killed' them, since pumpio *simply* removed the support of the group functionality ...

So it's more difficult for me now to stay connected with hackers news, and i'm interested with your investigation, and will follow you on your blog.

I feel that microblogging is better than RSS because it offers the ability not only to read, but to write (to comment, to review, to have a feed-back, to be connected with people),
and it give the possibility to join 'virtual communities'.

Bruno
PS : if i don't follow hacker news anymore on identica/statusnet, i now follow FSFE news :)
