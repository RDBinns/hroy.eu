Since March 2014, the kolab server is a debian machine. Trying out
CentOS was interesting, but now that the debian packages are good,
I went back to debian, which I know better.

However, there are still issues with Kolab on debian. The most
important issue at the moment, is that something in the database
will fail when you run the initial `kolab-setup` for version 3.1
on debian. See bug [#2811].

Tip: [enable external email addresses](https://blogs.fsfe.org/torsten.grote/2013/12/20/using-external-email-addresses-with-kolab/)

If you have trouble using the Files app within the web app, it’s
probably because of non-secure `http` connections. See bug
[#2436].


# Syncing: ActiveSync and DAV

I found that ActiveSync did not work very reliably for me. So I
switched to using DAV with [DAVDroid on Android][davdroid]. It’s
less buggy.

For me right now the main problem is that I can’t [sync with Emacs’
org-caldav](http://sjoberg.fi/blog/mykolab-org-mode.html), and I cannot access the webDAV with nautilus.

# Issues fixed in Kolab


#### `mod_ssl` not enabled by default

Moreover, for some odd reason, Kolab did not come with <code>mod_ssl</code>
installed, so you need to install it yourself and to set it up in
Apache.

## CardDav and CalDav server

After [setting up Kolab 3.1](/posts/kolab_up/), which includes a
cardDav and CalDav server, it is possible that, going with a web
browser to <https://totosh.ampoliros.net/iRony/> gives the error:

> Requested uri (/iRony/) is out of base uri

To fix this, change "null" in <code>/etc/iRony/dav.inc.php</code>

    $rcmail_config['base_uri'] = '/iRony/';

*Update*: this was fixed in [#2475].
