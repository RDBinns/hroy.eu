# CardDav and CalDav server

After [setting up Kolab 3.1](/posts/kolab_up/), I tried to get the
cardDav and CalDav server configured with clients. But it did not
work. Going with a web browser to
<https://totosh.ampoliros.net/iRony/> I got the error:

> Requested uri (/iRony/) is out of base uri

To fix the error you have to change "null" in
<code>/etc/iRony/dav.inc.php</code>

    $rcmail_config['base_uri'] = '/iRony/';
