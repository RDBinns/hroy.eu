# CardDav and CalDav server

After [setting up Kolab 3.1](/posts/kolab_up/), which includes a
cardDav and CalDav server, it is possible that, going with a web
browser to <https://totosh.ampoliros.net/iRony/> gives the error:

> Requested uri (/iRony/) is out of base uri

To fix this, change "null" in <code>/etc/iRony/dav.inc.php</code>

    $rcmail_config['base_uri'] = '/iRony/';
