[BBC: Microsoft admits reading Hotmail inbox of blogger](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26677607):

> Microsoft is caught up in a privacy storm after it admitted it
read the Hotmail inbox of a blogger while pursuing a software leak
investigation.

> While the search was technically legal, [Microsoft's deputy
general counsel] added Microsoft would consult outside counsel in
the future.

So if it’s not just legal, but “technically legal”: what does that
mean? 

Yes, it means the way [companies like Microsoft handle privacy](http://tosdr.org/#microsoft) 
is wrong. Yet another example.
