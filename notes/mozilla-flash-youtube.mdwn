Mozilla is currently promoting the new Firefox 29 ([Go get it!][ffx29]). So they're asking us on Twitter: [What do you want for the Web?][moztwwant] So I clicked on their link [[!toggle id="mozyoutube" text="and here's what I got"]].

I haven't been able to play YouTube videos for weeks now. Sometimes, it works though. I have no idea what's going onâ€¦

Dear Mozilla, next time you publish a video on your website, I don't want Flash and I don't want YouTube. I want HTML5 video (in an open standard format, i.e. free of patent restrictions) and I don't want you to promote [a platform with crappy terms of service][tosdr-youtube].
