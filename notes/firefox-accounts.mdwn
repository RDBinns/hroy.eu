Since I first [set up Firefox Synx](posts/setup_mozilla-sync/),
things have changed. Mozilla thought that they needed to
completely change the user experience of setting it up in firefox,
thus discarding the previous firefox sync server for a totally new
system of “Firefox Accounts”.

That sounds nice, however at the moment it’s nowhere as easy to
set up if you want to self-host it instead of relying on Mozilla’s
services.

You have to start 3 services:

  - Sync [1.5](https://docs.services.mozilla.com/howtos/run-sync-1.5.html)
  - and the [Firefox Accounts Server](https://docs.services.mozilla.com/howtos/run-fxa.html)
      - <https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/>
      - <https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server/>

Unfortunately, the READMEs are not as good as before. Sometimes,
they ask you to change settings, but they don’t always tell you in
which file you should modify it; or it also happens that the file
they mention does not exist (e.g. the
[“config.json”](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/blob/master/README.md#configuration)).

I’ll have to give it another try… I hope that for next time, the
documentation will have improved.
