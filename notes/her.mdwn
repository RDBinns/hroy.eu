I just came back from the cinema, where I watched Spike Jonze’s
*Her*. I’m pretty sure this movie has got me thinking. One thing I
notice that was funny is how Theodore’s job kind of makes him 
fit the same role that *her*, the AI, is doing for him; i.e.
by writing letters for other people, expressing some of their most
*personal* emotions for them, he participates to this society
where the human self dissolves.

I guess what I’m saying isn’t making sense if you haven’t seen the
movie. So go see it! There aren’t movies like this every year!
