I’m having a splendid Sunday at my desk, working on some moot
cases for school.

Sometimes to get going, I need some good music to get in the mood.
If you’re like me, you’re probably listening to some ambient or
minimal music.

I’m on [[w Trentemøller]]’s 2006 *Last Resort* right now and it
feels great. I have no idea where I got that from, I just don’t
remember. But anyway, thanks to the person who gave me this!
