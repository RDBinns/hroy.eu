Somebody working at Mozilla put together [a timeline of facts
surrounding Brendan Eich’s resignation](https://medium.com/p/7645a4bf8a2).

> And the real tragedy here is that Mozilla would have sorted this
out satisfactorily if it hadn’t been sensationalized by the media
and turned into an internet witch hunt. Anyone who wrote a news
story, posted to their blog, or tweeted about Brendan without
understanding paragraph (i)(c) of the [Community Participation
Guidelines][cpgmoz] was part of the mob that brought Brendan down.
>
> For more than 15 years, Brendan fought for openness and freedom on
the web, and led many of the people who built that open and free
web. This week, in a senseless, vicious convulsion, the web turned
on him.
