I began using [mutt](http://mutt.org) in March 2013. (I was
using Gnome's Evolution before, but it searches were really slow
and one day I really freaked out when Evolution had a bug which
led me to believe that I couldn't see my emails since 2010. It
turns out everything was fine, but Evolution hang up on me).

Here is a list of mutt tips. My [~/.mutt][dot-mutt]
is public.
