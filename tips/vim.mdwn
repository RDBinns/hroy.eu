I began using [vim](http://vim.org) in January 2013. (I was mostly
using gedit before, but it was so slow at times that it couldn’t
keep up with me typing on the keyboard.) I suppose my use of vim
isn’t the most widespread. I write code occasionally only, I
mainly write emails and documents, so my set-up reflects this and
the tips I share here are not the most interesting for coders.

Here is a full list of vim tips. My beginner’s [~/.vim][dot-vim]
is public.
