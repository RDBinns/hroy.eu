Here’s a list of options I modified in my firefox’s [about:config](about:config). 

  - [middlemouse.contentLoadURL]: false

    I use the mouse middle click to copy and paste stuff. So when I accidentally  press that mouse middle click while reading a web page, I don’t want Firefox to load whatever’s in my buffer as a URL.

  - [browser.urlbar.trimURLs]: false

    Mozilla decided to look more like Google Chrome and started to hide relevant parts of the URL like `http://`. This feature has helped me exactly 0 time, while on the other hand it was annoying many times when sometimes copy/pasting from the URL bar would not give me the entire URL (the behaviour was not consistent, sometimes it would work).

  - Disabling [unsecure ciphers]
