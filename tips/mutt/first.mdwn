Once you have mutt up and running with the basic tools that will
allow you to fetch, view, edit and send email, there are a couple
of things that you probably need, no matter what:

  - In mutt, even if you are on the pager that lets you read a
  selected email, the ``<up>`` and ``<down>`` keys will not help
  you navigate *inside* the email; instead they will bring you to
  the previous or to the next email in the index.

    That’s rather weird and unexpected. One of the first thing I
    did was trying to scroll inside an email, and mutt suddenfly
    browsed dozens of emails from the index (even marking them as
    read…). That’s quite unhelpful. To solve this, add:

        bind pager <up> previous-line #scroll inside the message rather than the index
        bind pager <down> next-line

    That way, you can scroll, or use the arrow keys to read an
    email inside the pager.

    When the pager is not opened, the up and down keys will behave
    as usual in the index.

  - Changing between mailboxes can be a pain by default in mutt.
  You need to tell mutt where to find your several mailboxes, so
  you’ll be able to switch between them more easily (for instance
  by pressing ``y`` or with the sidebar). Add:

        mailboxes $Mail
